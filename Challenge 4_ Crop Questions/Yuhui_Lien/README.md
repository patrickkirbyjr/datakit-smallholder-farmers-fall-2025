## 1. Executive Summary

This notebook involves text data cleaning and preprocessing applied to 11.5M rows of English farmer questions, and then utilizes a Prioritized Lexical Classification approach to categorize general questions into predefined business concepts (e.g., Pest & Disease, Market & Finance).

The classification relies on finding keywords in the question text based on a **hierarchical priority structure**, ensuring consistency with business rules.

### Key Findings:

- The lexical approach provides rapid and interpretable topic assignments based on explicit keyword rules.
- This method requires meticulous maintenance of the keyword dictionary to remain effective.
- Preliminary results show an imbalance, with **66% Specific Questions** and **34% General Questions**.

## 2. Data

| **Source Data** | `parquet` file (Kaggle) | Loaded |
| **Target Column** | `question_content_cleaned` | Used |
| **Data Size** | ~11.5M rows | Processed |
| **Time Span** | Long-term dataset | Categorized |

## 3. Methodology: Prioritized Lexical Classification

The approach ensures high-priority topics (like immediate risks) are detected first.

### A. Data Preprocessing

- Basic cleaning: lowercasing, punctuation removal  
- Goal: maximize keyword match accuracy

### B. Prioritized Keyword Matching

Questions assigned to the **first matched category** using the priority order below:

1. **Immediate Action / Risk**  
2. **Foundational Management**  
3. **Farming Technique**  
4. **Conceptual**  
5. **Administrative / Vague**

### C. Tuning for Robustness

- Keyword dictionary requires regular updates.
- Unmatched questions → labeled **Unclassified**.

# challenge-4-crop-questions-transformer.ipynb

## 1. Executive Summary

This project categorizes **~100k rows of English farmer questions** using **Guided BERTopic**, addressing stability problems from standard clustering.

Key improvements include deep text cleaning and semi-supervised clustering using business-defined seed topics.

### Key Findings:

- High-volume data requires strong filtering (`min_topic_size=1000`).
- Seed topics successfully distinguish ambiguous concepts (e.g., poultry vs. planting).

## 2. Data

| Feature | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Source Data** | parquet | Loaded |
| **Target Column** | `question_content_cleaned` | Used |
| **Data Size** | 100k+ rows | Processed |

## 3. Methodology: Guided BERTopic and Optimization

### A. Deep Preprocessing

Custom cleaning solved issues like `poutry → poultry`.

- Replacements using `replacement_map`
- `CountVectorizer` with custom stopwords  
- `min_df=0.001` to remove noise

### B. Guided Clustering

Seed topics enforce business logic:

1. Market & Finance  
2. Pest & Disease  
3. Livestock  
4. Farming Technique  

### C. Hyperparameter Tuning

| Parameter | Purpose | Value | Reason |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| `min_topic_size` | HDBSCAN | 1000 | Prevent noisy micro-topics |
| `n_neighbors` | UMAP | 75 | More stable embedding |
| `n_components` | UMAP | 5 | Simplify structure |

### A. Subtopic Classification of General Questions using BERTopic

This BERTopic distribution chart suggests that the current model parameters still require further optimization to achieve a balanced and coherent classification. The most notable issue is the dominant presence of generic and vague clusters, such as the 'what_where_you_how' topic at 17.3%, which indicates the model is failing to create highly specific or actionable groups. Furthermore, the top four topics account for over two-thirds of the data, with several categories being overly broad (e.g., 'animal_milk_animals_what' at 16.1%), preventing a clear, fine-grained understanding of the underlying farmer concerns. This imbalance signals the need for refining hyperparameters or utilizing a more restrictive set of seed topics.


### Key Output Columns:

- `BERTopic_Topic_ID`
- `BERTopic_Label`
- `Topic_Key_Label`

### Next Steps:

1. Run full dataset (3M rows)  
2. Visualize hierarchical structure 
Optimize Clustering Parameters: Refine BERTopic hyperparameters (e.g., min_topic_size, UMAP settings) to reduce the volume of vague or overly broad clusters and improve the specificity of subtopic assignments. 


## Challenge 4: Crop Question Analysis: Analyzing Farmer Demand, Community Supply, and Knowledge Gaps

## 1. Executive Summary


### Key Findings: 📊

---

#### 1. Supply-Demand Mismatch and Critical Gaps (The Mismatch)

* **Critical Knowledge Gap (High-Volume/Low-Supply):** High-frequency, common farmer questions about **tomato** (Demand Volume Rank 6) and **crop** (Demand Volume Rank 7) are not represented in the "Supply Detail Top 10." This suggests that the detail and comprehensiveness of community knowledge supply are **significantly insufficient** relative to the high, recurring demand for these universal topics, potentially leading to repeated queries.
* **Balanced but High-Volume Response (Banana):** The topic **banana** shows high demand (Rank 9) but is also accompanied by relatively high Supply Detail (Rank 10). This indicates that while the questions are frequent, the community has strong, detailed knowledge-sharing members who are responding comprehensively.

---

#### 2. Demand Patterns (Farmer Questioning Behavior)

* **Dominant Demand (Repetitiveness):** **General Topic** (Rank 1), **cattle** (Rank 2), and **maize** (Rank 3) account for the largest volume of questions (Report A). This clearly identifies the most common and widespread agricultural and livestock challenges faced by the community.
* **Specialized Questioning Behavior (Specificity):** Farmers asking about niche crops like **peach** (Rank 1), **pear** (Rank 2), and $\text{setaria}$ (Rank 3) formulate the most complex and detailed questions (Report B). This behavior suggests that **askers must provide extensive context** to their peers in these niche areas, where established community knowledge may be sparse, to elicit a helpful response.

---

#### 3. Supply Patterns (Community Knowledge Flow)

* **High-Quality Knowledge Supply (High-Detail):** The longest and most detailed answers (high Supply Detail score) are concentrated on specialized topics such as $\text{rye}$ (Rank 1) and $\text{pigeon-pea}$ (Rank 2) (Report C). This demonstrates the existence of **passionate and highly experienced farmers** in these niche domains who are willing to share comprehensive, practical knowledge.
* **Non-Cattle Livestock Supply:** Topics related to non-cattle animals, specifically **bee** (Rank 4) and **poultry** (Rank 5), show strong Supply Detail, indicating a robust knowledge-sharing culture within these specific livestock sub-communities.

## 2. Data

| Column Used | Description | Purpose in Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `question_topic` | Pre-existing classification of the question's subject (e.g., maize, poultry). | Primary grouping variable for all cross-analyses. |
| `question_content_cleaned` | Cleaned text of the farmer's question. | Used to derive **Demand Complexity** ($\text{Specificity Score}$). |
| `response_content_cleaned` | Answer provided by the community. | Used to derive **Supply Detail** ($\text{Response Score}$). |

---

## 3. Methodology

The core of the analysis is a **Supply-Demand Mismatch Model** built on three key quantifiable metrics:

### 3.1 Feature Engineering (Quantification)
To allow for direct comparison, we used **Min-Max Normalization** to scale all metrics to a uniform $[0, 1]$ range.

* **Demand Volume (Report A):** Raw count of questions per topic.
* **Demand Complexity Score (Report B):** Calculated by normalizing the raw **Question Length** (word count) for *each individual question*, then taking the average score per topic. (Higher score = more detailed demand).
* **Supply Detail Score (Report C):** Calculated by normalizing the raw **Answer Length** (word count) for *each individual response*, then taking the average score per topic. (Higher score = more detailed supply).


### 3.2 Cross-Topic Analysis
Metrics were aggregated using `df.groupby('question_topic').agg()`. The analysis focused on identifying patterns where **Demand Complexity $\ne$ Supply Detail**.

**Figure 2:** Ranking of Topics by Average Farmer Question Complexity.

* **Takeaway:** Farmer effort is highest for niche crops ($\text{peach}, \text{pear}$), indicating these specialized subjects require maximum user input for proper context.

### Report C: Knowledge Supply Detail Ranking
![report_c_supply_detail_seaborn](https://github.com/yhlien1221/datakit-smallholder-farmers-fall-2025/blob/main/Challenge%204_%20Crop%20Questions/Yuhui_Lien/pictures/report_c_supply_detail_seaborn.png)
**Figure 3:** Ranking of Topics by Average Answer Detail (Supply).

* **Takeaway:** The system's resource allocation for detail is highest for topics driven by **knowledge scarcity** ($\text{rye}, \text{pigeon-pea}$).

### Next Steps:

1. **Knowledge Quality Assessment (BERTopic)**: Implement BERTopic to analyze community response content, shifting the focus from mere answer length to knowledge focus and quality to precisely identify true information gaps.
